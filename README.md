The 3 folders contain materials to produce the following set of results:

### (1) Empirical evidence on the impact of R&D shocks and monetary policy shocks 
* "SmallScaleVAR.do" estimates small-scale R&D VAR 
* "LargeScaleVAR.do" estimates large-scale R&D VAR 
* "LargeScaleVAR.do" estimates monetary VAR 

### (2) Model estimation using impulse response matching  
* "Estimation.m" launches model estimation
* Output includes Figures 2,5,6 in the paper

### (3) Model results and experiments 
* Files "Replic_Fig*.m" produce output corresponding to Figures 3,4,7,8,9 in the paper
